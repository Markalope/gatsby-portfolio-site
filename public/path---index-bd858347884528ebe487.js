Keeping my affinity for computer technology alive throughout my college years, I majored in Art/Graphic Design and began working as a digital production artist in the advertising and marketing industry. As Internet-driven services and the Web evolved, my career kept pace and I have spent the majority of my career as a Technical Project Manager for interactive, web and software products. I have managed products and teams delivering solutions for many industries including apparel and footwear, consumer electronics and tech-industry products. Recently, I have undertaken a year-long process to improve my software development skills and am now a Full-Stack Javascript developer, equally interested in front-end and back-end development. I plan to combine my development, project management and design skills into the next stage of my career as a working developer."}}}]},allContentfulProject:{edges:[{node:{projectName:"Project GitGrub",projectShortDescription:{projectShortDescription:"A reality-show inspired cooking challenge game.
